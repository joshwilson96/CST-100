%b, %c, %d, %f, and $s.
24.1 Suppose LIST is an instance of MyList, can you get and iterator for LIST using list.iterator?
Yes
24.4 What are the benefits of defining both Mylist interface and the MyAbstractList class?
Because using MyAbstractList provides a partial implementation  of the MyList interface, whole MyList deines the methods for manpiultaing a list
